# Changelog

## Unreleased

First version. Nothing to migrate.

- `siftr run -- CMD` runs a command, passes its output through unchanged (colour included, via a PTY), exits with its code, and prints what changed since recent runs of the same command to stderr.
- RSpec + Rails: per-example results come from a reporter listener added through `SPEC_OPTS` (your formatters are untouched), and SQL and request lines from the slice of `log/test.log` the run wrote.
- Signals: ERROR, NEW, DISAPPEARED, FREQUENCY (SQL counts, per-request and per-example query counts) and LATENCY (a single example, at least +100ms and 4x). Related signals are grouped under one headline. Confidence comes from the size of the baseline.
- `changes`, `explain`, `evidence`, `summary`, `history` to drill from a change to the raw lines behind it. Every command takes `-j`.
- `siftr ingest` records a file, stdin, or a captured scenario directory (`--dir`) as a run.
- Ctrl-C'd runs are kept for evidence but never used as a baseline.
